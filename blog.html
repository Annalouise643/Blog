        First blog post! Adding a border down each side of my Art page
      </h3>
      <img
        class="border-screenshot"
        src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/051/890/original/Screenshot_2022-11-06_at_18.40.27.png?1667760140"
        alt="screenshot of border"
      />

      <p>
        I tried scanning in a vertical border I had painted and adding it to the
        Art page of my website but it did not work first time! I wrapped the
        whole contents of the page in a row, then split it into three columns,
        with the border in one column, then the rest of the page contents in the
        next column, then the border again in the third column. It didn't work
        and instead of seeing border on the right, content in the middle, and
        corder on the left, it showed border at the top, then rest of the
        content below, then border again underneath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Troubleshooting, first attempt. I did a quick google of how to use
        columns (I haven't done any CSS in a while and I'm rusty), played around
        a bit, and didn't get anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Troubleshooting, second attempt. Is is because the images are block
        elements and they need to be inline for this to work? (It's been so long
        since I did any html I couldn't even remember the terminology for
        'block'/'inline'). This didn't work either, although the first border
        was on the left (albeit above the rest of the content), and the second
        border was on the right (under the rest of the content).
      </p>
      <p>
        Troubleshooting, third attempt. I then wondered whether, when I first
        coded the grid for the main content, I had somehow fixed it to a certain
        width, meaning that there was no space for additional columns to either
        side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps I need to put the columns inside the existing container? Fixed!
        It doesn't look great yet, as the border doesn't continue down the page
        and it doesn't work on mobile, but it's a start! I found an article on
        pair.com called 'Understanding Bootstrapâ€™s Grid System', which reminded
        me that in bootstrap, rows and columns need to be inside a container. It
        also reminded me of the syntax, which I had misremembered.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then somehow managed to break it again but I could not figure out how!
        I had committed my changes when I got it to work so to revert to that
        version I went to Source Countrol in VS code, and revert all my changes
        since that commit. Now it works again.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now the borders are showing up on either side but they have a dark
        background from the poor quality scan and becuase the paper I painted on
        wasn't completely white. I used the Instant Alpha tool in Preview to
        remove the background. No more background but there is still a grey
        border around the images. I tried to remove this in Preview by setting
        the border to transparent but that didn't work. ...Turns out it was
        because I had given it a class name of "border"! Note to self, take more
        care with naming. Renamed "border-art" and the border disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I want to make th image repeat down the page. I tried adding the CSS
        property "background-repeat: repeat-y;", both to the body of the whole
        page and to a div inside the right hand column, but nothing happened. I
        practiced in a new blank file, using "body { background-image:
        url("https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/051/876/original/Scan_10.png?1667754760");
        background-repeat: repeat-y; background-size: 60px; }", and it worked,
        but on one side only. I copied this directly into the body of my css
        file. It worked, but shows on every page (not just Art), and only on the
        left hand side. I gave the body of my Art page a class name of
        "art-body" and only applied the proprty there. Now it's only showing up
        on my Art page, but again on the left hand side. Next, I cut the css
        properties from the body of the Art page and added to the first and
        third columns, setting the width of each to col-3. This only worked on
        the left hand side. I then adjusted the width of the columns to col-2
        and now the border is showing on both sides. I set the
        background-position to center and voila!
      </p>

      <p>
        Next up... recap CSS and revise bootstrap grids. And learn how to make
        an image border without using a grid (CSS border images?).

      <h3 class="titles">CSS Hack 'Clearfix'</h3>

      <p>
        When I made my first Weather App with SheCodes I remember spending ages
        trying to get the temperature and the icon to align. I managed it in the
        end, I can't really remember how but I think by using a span and
        adjusting the size, margin and padding by eye.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
          <img
            class="weather-icon"
            src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/054/750/original/Screenshot_2022-11-20_at_13.06.30.png?1668949774"
            alt="weather icon"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="col 6">
          <img
            class="weather-icon"
            src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/054/751/original/Screenshot_2022-11-20_at_13.07.45.png?1668949804"
            alt="weather icon"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now, as I'm working through the SheCodes React course, the instructor
        has suggested fixing the alignment of the icon and the temperature by
        floating the image to the left and using 'Clearfix'. I don't think we
        have covered Clearfix in the course so I did a quick google and came
        accross this

          href="https://css-tricks.com/clearfix-a-lesson-in-web-development-evolution/"

        people contribute to the discussion.
