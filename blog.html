      <h4>First blog post! Adding a border down each side of my Art page</h4>
      <p>
        I tried scanning in a vertical border I had painted and adding it to the
        Art page of my website but it did not work first time! I wrapped the
        whole contents of the page in a row, then split it into three columns,
        with the border in one column, then the rest of the page contents in the
        next column, then the border again in the third column. It didn't work
        and instead of seeing border on the right, content in the middle, and
        corder on the left, it showed border at the top, then rest of the
        content below, then border again underneath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Troubleshooting, first attempt. I did a quick google of how to use
        columns (I haven't done any CSS in a while and I'm rusty), played around
        a bit, and didn't get anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Troubleshooting, second attempt. Is is because the images are block
        elements and they need to be inline for this to work? (It's been so long
        since I did any html I couldn't even remember the terminology for
        'block'/'inline').
